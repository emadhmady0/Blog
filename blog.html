                <h3>Weight Management</h3>
                <p>Sleep plays a significant role in regulating hormones that control appetite. When you don't get enough sleep, your body produces more ghrelin (hunger hormone) and less leptin (satiety hormone), increasing the risk of overeating and weight gain.</p>
